 1. On podman, the stage latest contains /home/user/faiss, which is frustrating.
    Two ways to fix:
     - Instead of coping, which is tricky, just delete `/usr/local/src/faiss` and pass `--squash` to `podman`/`docker`.
     - Just store `faiss` build tree in `/home/user/faiss`.

    This problem seems to be only happen with `podman`, but not `docker`.
